    "Title: KSL AutomoDeals\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Names: Chantel Charlebois, Taylor Hansen, Michael Paskett\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "E-mails: chantel.charlebois@utah.edu, taylor.c.hansen@utah.edu, michael.paskett@utah.edu\n",

    "\n",
    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every person in Utah (and some neighboring states) buying a used car will visit KSL Cars classifieds to look for their new wheels. There are a few resources for understanding the rough value of a used car, such as Kelly Blue Book (https://www.kbb.com) and CarGurus (https://www.cargurus.com/), but such services may not fully incorporate the complex auto market of a local area. By storing and analyzing the prices, details, and options for a certain model or class of vehicle, a prospective buyer can evaluate how good the listed price for a vehicle actually is. With such a model, the user can estimate how much a specific car is really worth, and determine if the vehicle is worthy of a test drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "* How well can we predict the price of a newly-listed car based on the attributes available in an a ksl advertisement?\n",
    "* Which attributes are most influential in determining the vehicle price?\n",
    "* What nearby areas have the best price of cars?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aims:\n",
    "* Create a regression model that will predict the expected price of a car based on several attributes, such as:\n",
    "    * year,  seller type (dealer/private), mileage, color, title (clean/salvaged), transmission type, cylinders, fuel type, number of doors, exterior/interior condition, listing date, page views rate\n",
    "* Create a clustered map of “good deals” in different regions\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "* This project could benefit anyone in the market for a used car in the KSL area, helping them to be informed of the potential value of a car they are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders:\n",
    "* The creators (us)\n",
    "* The seller\n",
    "* The prospective buyer\n",
    "* KSL\n",
    "\n",
    "Our incentive as creators and prospective buyers is to find good deals without having to manually spend hours searching through KSL for a good deal. For other prospective buyers, the same applies. The sellers have competing interests, as they would like to sell their car for as much as possible. KSL also has a stake in this project, as it makes revenue from ads and from sellers paying for better listings in order to make their vehicle more prominent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We scraped our data from queries of used cars listed on [cars.ksl.com](https://cars.ksl.com/). We read the robots.txt files for both ksl.com and cars.ksl.com to confirm that there were no restrictions for crawling their website. We also reviewed the terms and conditions and similarly found no indication for rules on crawling. There used to be an undocumented API for interfacing with KSL (as of four years ago), but it is no longer publicly accessible, so we manually scraped the data with BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid consistently using too much bandwidth on their website, our initial plan was to start with “historical” data collection by saving .html pages over the course of the project so that we could parse them offline. However, we found that KSL listings are dynamically loaded by JavaScript, and the html files were bloated with other associated files which would be too unwieldy to download on a daily basis (on the order of 5,000 cars/day). Instead, we opted for a live crawler approach to get our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After an initial crawl through the website to get as many used cars listings as possible, we automated the crawler to go in every night at a randomly scheduled time and pull any newly listed cars not already in our repository. The code associated with this crawler was developed initially in various Jupyter notebooks before porting over to .py files for automation. The code is not included in the present notebook given its length. The crawler/scraping functions are described in more detail in the Project Milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used CarGurus website https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/sell-car/?pid=SellMyCarDesktopHeader and their API to request an expected car price based on each car's Make, Model, Mileage, Year, and Zip Code. "

Of course, many listings have many more details listed than these which we also incorporated into our analysis (as shown in the example listing above).\n",

Next we visualized the data using a scatterplot matrix in order to check the histograms of each parameter for outliers and general trends. We also used the scatterplot matrix to explore correlations between different parameters. We also visualized a heat map of the correlation matrix to determine which parameters were strongly correlated.

We changed the data to missing if the car year was older than 1920, the price was less than 100 dollars or greater than 500000 dollars, the mileage was greater than 500,000 miles, or the liters was greater than 100. This cleaned up most of the outliers and the describe() values look much more realistic. We then converted the categorical variables of title_type, seller, transmission, and drive_type to numerical categorical variables of 0 or 1 so that we could include them in our regression analysis."
